[00:09.15] You're getting on a plane and leaving
[00:16.52] I hope you're staying not too far
[00:22.41] Coz all those dreams I had were real ones
[00:30.32] But something got in the way
[00:34.30] Time it just couldn't wait
[00:47.30] 
[00:38.07] Don't grow up too fast
[00:44.45] Don't leave me in the past
[00:51.74] As long as you never change who you are
[00:58.91] Ill know that in your heart
[01:02.15] You're never far
[01:04.80] (Oh)
[01:06.80] 
[01:06.78] Got so caught up in 'all the used to be's'
[01:21.96] Forgot to look into the now's
[01:27.38] I'm proud of you I'll say
[01:31.94] Though I'm still stuck in childish ways
[01:35.38] Those memories that we made
[01:38.52] I know they play in your brain
[01:43.05] (Oh)
[01:45.05] 
[01:43.16] Don't grow up too fast
[01:54.51] Don't leave me in the past
[01:56.25] As long as you never change who you are
[02:03.15] I'll know that in your heart
[02:06.23] You're never far
[02:14.23] 
[02:10.28] I guess I thought there'd be more
[02:13.85] Time for us to spend
[02:16.59] Just like how it used to be
[02:19.82] Turning moments to history
[02:25.14] But there I go again reminiscing
[02:28.78] Far too much
[02:30.55] It's time I move on
[02:34.23] Just know my love will stay strong
[02:51.23] 
[02:39.44] Don't grow up too fast
[02:47.78] Don't leave me in the past
[02:54.95] As long as you never change who you are
[03:03.45] I'll know that in your heart
[03:05.87] I'll know that in your heart
[03:10.02] Don't grow up too fast
[03:16.11] Don't leave me in the past
[03:23.21] Coz times will change but
[03:25.84] That don't mean you have to
[03:30.66] I cant grow up without
[03:36.12] I cant grow up without
[03:42.52] You
